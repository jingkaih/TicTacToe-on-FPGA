# TicTacToe-on-FPGA
This is a TicTacToe game on FPGA. A VGA screen and a matrix keypad are needed to implement.

Two modes:
* Human vs Human
* Human vs Simple AI
By toggling the switch, you can choose which mode to play

## PLL is needed
I'm setting the output frequency to 25MHz to drive 640*480 pixels' screen
